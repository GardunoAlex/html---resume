        Hello! As mentioned, my name is Alexander but I just go by Alex. I am currently a second year computer science student at the University of Minnesota. Growing up, I loved technology. Whether it was the new phone or the latest gaming console, I wanted to be the most informed. Graduating highschool, this love turned into Computer Science. Having the ability to build and tell a computer what I want it to do, is something that makes me lose track of time. My future aspirations consist of becoming a Software Developer or a Machine Learning Engineer.
